London -LRB- CNN -RRB- Boris Johnson 's sister once said that as a child , he wanted to be `` World King '' when he grew up .

Now one of the most divisive politicians of his generation is just days away from fulfilling his lifelong dream of becoming the United Kingdom 's prime minister , if polls are to be believed .
The result of the governing Conservative party 's leadership contest might not be announced until July 23 , but at this point , virtually no one believes that his opponent , Jeremy Hunt , can turn around the Johnson juggernaut .
The crucial question being asked in the UK , at a critical moment in the nation 's history , is what exactly drives the man most likely to lead the country in under two weeks ? The best way to answer this question is to understand exactly why he is so divisive .
First , there 's his personal style . Johnson 's chaotic way of doing politics offends as much as it enthralls . He has a history of making seemingly thoughtless comments , such as saying that women who wear Islamic face veils look `` like letterboxes '' or calling people from the British Commonwealth `` flag-waving piccaninnies '' with `` watermelon smiles .
